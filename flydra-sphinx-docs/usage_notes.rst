Tips and tricks for using the MainBrain GUI and other such things.

MainBrain GUI hot-keys
----------------------

*N.B.*, keys are listed as single uppercase letters. In some cases the
result of pushing such a key will be echoed to the GUI status bar
(along bottom of window).

* **S** toggle saving data (3d kalman position, camera 2d positions,
  etc.) to disk.

* **R** toggle background running average, for use in reducing false
  positives. Note that any recorded background filter is *saved*; see
  "clear background" hot-key below.

* **C** clear background filter. Effectively reset running average.

* **T** take new background images. Tip from Floris: "hit synrchronize
  every time you do this."
