= Overview of the Flydra Trigger Device =

The Flydra Trigger Device serves to provide a synchronized trigger
signal to all cameras providing input to the Main Brain. By use of a
custom trigger device, precise timing of frame-by-frame inputs can be
verified. (See the [source:trunk/flydra/flydra/a2/check_atmel_clock.py
check_atmel_clock.py] script for an example.) Furthermore, additional
experimental components can be triggered by the device by use of the
External Device Trigger.

This device is an
[http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=3879
AT90USBKEY] placed in a custom enclosure with some minimal additional
circuitry and custom firmware.

The primary connections are A) the USB interface, which connects to
the Main Brain computer, and B) the Camera Sync Triggers, which
connects to the flydra cameras.

In addition the External Device Trigger, can be used to trigger
experimental devices via a software command from the Main Brain
computer over the USB interface.

= Internal connection details =

The Camera Sync Triggers are the bottom row of BNCs on the
device. Internally, they all share the same input. This is a direct
connection from the AT90USBKEY J5 pin 7 (and thus Port C6, OCR3A, of
the AT90USB1287). Optionally, an op-amp to provide a 5V trigger signal
may be added (see below).

The External Device Trigger is the top left BNC on the
device. Internally, this is a direct connection from the AT90USBKEY J5
pin 4 (and thus Port C3 of the AT90USB1287). Optionally, an op-amp to
provide a 5V trigger signal may be added (see below).

= Optional 5V outputs =

An optional Op-Amp may be used to boost the output signal voltage from
3.3V to 5.0V.
