The Flydra Trigger Device
*************************

The Flydra Trigger Device serves to provide a synchronized trigger
signal to all cameras providing input to the Main Brain. By use of a
custom trigger device, precise timing of frame-by-frame inputs can be
verified.

All aspects of the trigger device are now hosted here:
