FOE_utils.py
============
Utility module opens .h5 files and trigger log files.

foe_1_filter_triggers.py
========================

What it does:
-------------

Selects triggered expansions based on a maximum roundtrip latency,
which might throw away some usable data, but eliminates all unusable
data due to long latencies before visual stimulus.

Output files:
-------------
 accepted_triggers.txt

foe_2_prelim_analysis.py
========================

What it does:
-------------

Selects only usable chunks of data from the original raw data
files. Plots some prelinary figures.

Input files:
------------

 *.h5                           -- raw data files saved by flydra
 accepted_triggers.txt OR *.log -- list of visual stimulus triggers

Output files:
-------------

 strict_data.txt                -- pre-processed data

Notes:
------
This script was formerly known as 'plot_foe.py'.
